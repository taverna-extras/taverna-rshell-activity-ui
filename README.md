# RShell activity workbench plugin for Taverna

This is a plugin providing support for the 
[rshell activity](https://github.com/taverna-extras/taverna-rshell-activity)
for [Apache Taverna (incubating)](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/)
Workbench.

It is provided as part of the [Taverna extras](https://github.com/taverna-extras/)
as this plugin ultimately relies on [Rserve](https://rforge.net/Rserve/)'s
[REngine library](https://github.com/s-u/REngine), which is [licensed as

`org.apache.taverna` package names.
